# outlawalert
Detect if player thief a car or if someone use a firegun somewhere.

# Todo #

* ~~Blip on thief~~
* ~~Blip on shoot~~
* Blip for melee
* Outlaw status: a way to know if a player is outlaw or not when we aim it
* The Outlaw don't see it was marked at outlaw (show nothing on map and see nothing in chat)


# Bugs #

* The game take time to detect that a player actually try to thief a car without ped inside, don't know why...
